It also aims to highlight the most important standard coding style rules and to foster R coding good practices. Additionally, it provides a list of useful R resources organized by topics and a list caveats and common mistakes to avoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis book is meant for all R users at esqLABS at apply to all R code written for projects. For development guidelines, please refer to the OSPS-R coding standards"

Use camelCase to separate words within a name. \n# Good\n\nfitModel &lt;- function(){}\n\nresultsDf &lt;- data.frame()\n\n# Bad\n\nfit_model &lt;- function(){}\n\nResultsDf &lt;- data.frame()\nClass names should use PascalCasing.\nTrue constant variables should use ALL_CAPS casing. \n# Good\nCONSTANT_VAR &lt;- 1\n\n# Bad\n\nconstant_var &lt;- 1\nconstantVar &lt;- 1\nUse meaningful and understandable names. The code should read as a story and only some well-known abbreviations (such as pk) should be used.\n# Good\n\n# Primary key\npk &lt;- 1\n\n# Bad\n\n# Primary key\nprimary_key &lt;- 1\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Spacing\nBecause it is not explicitly said in the tidyverse guideline and for improved code readability, use the following indentation settings:\n\nUse indentation of 2, \nUse spaces instead of tabs."
