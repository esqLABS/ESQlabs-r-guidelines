The esqLABS R Coding Standards book establishes guidelines to ensure that
scripts are written in a unified manner that promotes readability,
reproducibility and comprehension for all team members at esqLABS.

This book introduces [esqLABS coding style specifications](style.qmd) that
must be followed by all esqLABS collaborators when writing R code. 
It also aims to highlight the

foster [R coding good practices](good_practices.qmd).
Additionally, it provides a [list of useful R resources](resources.qmd) 
organized by topics and a list [caveats and common mistakes](caveats.qmd) to avoid.
